# Assemble Base Pattern Library

## Prerequisites

The Pattern Lab Node - webpack edition uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for core processing, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage project dependencies, and [webpack.io](https://webpack.github.io/) to run tasks and interface with the core library. Node version 4 or higher suffices. You can follow the directions for [installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on the Node website if you haven't done so already. Installation of Node will include npm.
