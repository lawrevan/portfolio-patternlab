title: Media Block
---

This contains the styling for a media block, which contains:
- Image
- Content:
	- Headline
	- Description (optional)
	- Button (optional)


By default, the image is on the left and the content is on the right.

A modifier class `m-media-block--reversed` can be added to the wrapper in order to have the image on the right and the content on the left.
